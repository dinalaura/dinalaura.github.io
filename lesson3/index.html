            <h3>Site Description</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the SOAtheory.com website, its purpose and intended audience, <br>
            utilization scenarios, and other aspects such as its organization and structure, elements of style, etc. It is to be used <br>
             as a planning and elaboration tool for the personal site to be developed this semester as part of the WDD 230 <br>
             course.</p>

             <h3>Site Name</h3>
             LOGO
              <p>
                This site is going to be called SOAtheory.com. As the name indicates, it will be a repository of knowledge regarding <br>
                Service Oriented Architectures, or SOA for short.</p>

                <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>
                <p>The main purpose of the SOAtheory.com website will be to educate users about what Service Oriented <br>
                    Architectures (SOA) are, their benefits, and implementation best practices. This objective will be fulfilled through the <br>
                    descriptions of what an SOA is and what isnâ€™t, explanation of design principles and the main tenets of the SOA <br>
                    paradigm, as well as through he presentation of case studies where SOA has been implemented successfully. <br>

                    A secondary purpose is to provide a source of proven implementation and design patterns for common SOA <br>
                    implementation challenges. This will be presented in the form of lists of patterns, withdrawn from various sources, <br>
                     and links to authoritative sources of SOA expertise and knowledge. <br>

                    The soatheory.com website will be used to inform readers about SOA, or Service Oriented Architectures, its <br>
                     concepts, applications, main features, and case studies of where it has been successfully applied.</p>
