                    <h2>Snow in Spring</h2>
                    <p>
                        by Dina Moreno <br>
                        <br>
                        Some years ago, I got the invitation to attend a wedding in Utah. It was Spring, and I was happy because I had the chance to visit in the best season of the year, right? Since I live in one of the hottest parts of Mexico, I wasn't ready to have snow in Spring! I was used to visiting the south part of Texas, which is just four hours from my hometown, and I thought it would be the same in Utah. 
                        <br>I packed light, just a pair of jeans, shirts, and sneakers. Then I hit the road in my car traveling to Laredo, Texas, where I had to take my flight, but I forgot that in the USA, the Day Light Saving Time starts one week before. I was already late, and then I huge truck crashed on the highway, and I missed my flight. 
                        <br>That night I slept in my car, and the next day I went to Utah, I arrived just in time for the wedding. I was so happy that I forgot that it was snowing and I had not a coat, but a gentleman lend me his jacket. Days after that I was all by myself in the Front Runner, I met with my best friend in Orem, she was so glad I was there that she bought me a pair of boats and took me to the mountains to enjoy the snow in Spring.
